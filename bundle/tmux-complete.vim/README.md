# tmux-complete.vim

Vim plugin for insert mode completion of words in adjacent tmux panes

## Motivation

If you're using Vim in tandem with Tmux you might be familiar with this pesky
situation:

You're happily editing your lovely files in Vim, when you notice you need to
type a word that you can see in a different Tmux pane right next to Vim. This
might be some secret key found in your REPL or the name of a failing test.

Usually the interesting text is too short to warrant switching panes and going
into Tmux' copy mode, so you end typing it out again.

## But fear no longer!

This plugin adds a completion function that puts all words visible in your Tmux
panes right under your fingertips. Just enter insert mode, start typing any
word you see and press `<C-X><C-U>` to the trigger user defined insert mode
completion.

## Third party integration

Tmux complete is automatically integrated with the following plugins:

- [neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim): You can see tmux
    completions right in your neocomplete pop-up.

- [unite](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim): You can use tmux complete
    as a unite source:

    ```vim
    Unite tmuxcomplete       " opens a menu containing words from adjacent tmux windows
    Unite tmuxcomplete/lines " opens a menu containing words from adjacent tmux windows and lines where they were found
    ```

## Installation

Use your favorite plugin manager.

- [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)

    ```vim
    NeoBundle 'wellle/tmux-complete.vim'
    ```

- [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)

    ```vim
    Bundle 'wellle/tmux-complete.vim'
    ```

- [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

    ```sh
    git clone git://github.com/wellle/tmux-complete.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/tmux-complete.vim
    ```

## Settings

Use the `#trigger` option to tune the way you interact with
tmux-complete by putting one of these lines into your `.vimrc`:

- By default, tmux-complete sets Vim's `completefunc`, that can be invoked with
    `<C-X><C-U>`.

    ```vim
    let g:tmuxcomplete#trigger = 'completefunc'
    ```

- Alternatively, you can use Vim's `omnifunc`, that can be invoked with
    `<C-X><C-O>`. This setting also integrates with
    [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) so you can see
    Tmux completions when hitting `<C-Space>`.

    ```vim
    let g:tmuxcomplete#trigger = 'omnifunc'
    ```

- If you're using the [neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim)
    integration, you probably don't need the additional trigger.

    ```vim
    let g:tmuxcomplete#trigger = ''
    ```

The trigger function itself is named `tmuxcomplete#complete` (in case you want
to call it manually).
